    "goal": "Maximize CTR by inducing anticipation and resolving cognitive tension via the curiosity gap.",
    "emotion_trigger": "Curiosity, fear (danger), or shock/surprise; sadness correlates with high view counts.",
    "creature_visibility": "Partial reveal (silhouette, eyes, or blurred objects) to withhold the full story and create mystery.",
    "scale_contrast": "Juxtaposition of massive creatures against tiny subjects (human silhouettes, submarines, or ships) to hyperbolize scale.",
    "subject_position": "Focal point (eyes/subject) at Rule of Thirds intersections or centered; subject occupies 40%–50% of frame.",
    "camera_framing": "Tight crop or extreme close-up on faces/eyes to trigger social accountability and facial recognition priority.",
    "lighting": "High-contrast (minimum 4.5:1 ratio); use shadows or bright borders to separate subject from the abyss.",
    "color_palette": "Deep blues/blacks + neon accents (Cyan/Teal/Orange); use red for urgency; avoid \"YouTube red\" to prevent UI clashing.",
    "background": "High simplicity (empty abyss or blurred); maximum 3 elements total to prevent cognitive overload.",

    "avoid": "Full creature reveal (kills mystery), clutter (>3 elements), low-resolution images, and muted contrast."
